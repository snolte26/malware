# Malware

Repository containing different malware I've made, for educational purposes only 

## List:

### BatchBomb Creator

When ran, this script creates a .txt file on a targets computer. In that file, the word "start" is written for 1,000,000 lines, then the file is converted into a .bat file. when the batch file is ran, it will attempt to open tons of terminal windows causing the computer to grind to a halt

### PyKeylogger

When ran, the keylogger bigins to log every key press that a user makes, along with the date and time of each key press. if converted to a .pyw file, there wont even be a terminal window that shows up

### Virus Deployer

When ran, the virus deployer disguises itself as a dice roller app. Users can use this like a normal dice roller, such as for Dungeons & Dragons. However if the user tries to roll a certain amount of dice, a subprocess is started, deploying the keylogger from earlier into the users startup folder. The script downloads the keylogger straight from github, rather than from a text file

### selfReplicator

When ran, the script begins to create copies of itself within its directory. There is a line that is commented out for safety, which would cause the file to start running the copies, quickly filling up storage space

### usbFileExtractor

This script is meant to be ran from a USB flash drive. A user would stick the drive into a targets unsecure computer, and the script would copy everything from the targest desktop, documents, and photos to the flash drive
